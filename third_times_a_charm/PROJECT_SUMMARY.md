# Engineering Test Report Generator - Project Summary

## 🎯 **Project Overview**
Built a robust, extensible Python MVC application for generating engineering test reports with a VS Code-like GUI. The application manages test data, cover page information, and equipment used, supporting dynamic editing via tksheet, and generates reports. The codebase is clear, maintainable, and well-documented with a focus on correct equipment data handling and real-time GUI updates.

### Report Folder Structure:
```
[Report Name]/
├── cover_page/
│   ├── product_information.json
│   ├── general_specifications.json
│   ├── testing_and_review.json
│   └── equipment_used.json          # ← CENTRALIZED equipment storage (JSON)
├── tests/
│   ├── [category]/
│   │   └── [test_name]/
│   │       ├── csv/
│   │       │   └── data.csv          # ← Test data only (no equipment CSV)
│   │       ├── images/
│   │       └── latex/
│   └── test_selections.json
└── report/
    └── [generated reports]
```

### Equipment Storage (CRITICAL):
- ✅ **Centralized**: All equipment stored ONLY in `cover_page/equipment_used.json`
- ✅ **JSON Format**: List of lists compatible with tksheet
- ❌ **No CSV**: Individual tests do NOT have equipment_used.csv files
- ✅ **Global Equipment**: All tests use the same equipment pool

## 🔧 **Equipment System**
### Headers (Standardized):
1. Equipment Type
2. Manufacturer  
3. Model
4. Description
5. S/N
6. Last Calibrated
7. Calibration Due

### Display Format:
`Equipment Type - manufacturer - model - description - s/n`
(Only non-empty fields shown)

## 🏗️ **Architecture**
- **Model**: Manages JSON files for cover page sections, CSV files for test data
- **View**: Three-pane VS Code-like layout (file tree, center editor, equipment pane)

- Python >= 3.8

## 🔧 **Development Guidelines**

### Code Style:
- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maintain comprehensive docstrings
- Keep methods focused and single-purpose

### Data Handling:
- Always use absolute paths for file operations
- Validate data before saving
- Handle file not found and permission errors
- Use JSON for configuration, CSV for tabular data

### Equipment System Rules:
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Equipment stored ONLY in `cover_page/equipment_used.json`
- Never create per-test equipment CSV files
- Always refresh equipment list after tksheet changes
- Use standardized 7-column format everywhere

## 📝 **Known Limitations**
1. **Equipment Selection**: Checkboxes don't persist selections across sessions
2. **Test Data**: Limited validation on user input
3. **File Locking**: No protection against concurrent access to files
4. **Memory Usage**: Large datasets may impact performance
5. **Error Recovery**: Limited ability to recover from corrupted data files

## 🚨 **Important Notes for Next Session**
1. **Equipment System**: Fully functional with centralized JSON storage
2. **Debug Output**: Present in controller.py - remove after confirming functionality
3. **File Structure**: Automatically creates proper directory structure for new reports
4. **Data Flow**: Model ↔ Controller ↔ View communication working correctly
5. **State Management**: Title updates and navigation working properly
